# Move-Selection *Plugins for MuseScore 4.x*
A collection of MuseScore 4.x plugins for moving a range selection left, right, up, or down; copy selection to stave above or below, or add an empty measure to selected staves without adding one for the whole system. Works with multiple voices and staff selections.

## Usage
 - Select a range of notes and run the corresponding plugin to move the selection left or right by an eighth note, or move to the staff above or below.
 - You can also copy the selection to the staff above or below, or add an empty measure solely to the selected staves.
